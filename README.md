-To test a secret() function, write it the pardot.rb file.

-Make sure that only the secret() function you wish to check is uncommented. 

-Run pardot.rb from the command-line and include the number argument (e.g. "ruby pardot.rb 10").

-Note that the additive_checker method returns a boolean and does not print a 'true' or 'false' string.
